# Network Overview and Key Metrics

Bitica is the decentralized public blockchain that powers the Bitica ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of Bitica.

The Bitica blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake \(dPoS\) for achieving consensus. The consensus is currently secured by 39 validators, only one of which is run by the Bitica core team.

The blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on Bitica is currently around 5 seconds, and it costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.
