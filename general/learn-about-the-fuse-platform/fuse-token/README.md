# Bitica Token (BDCC)

The BDCC token is the native currency of the Bitica blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## BDCC utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Bitica blockchain, BDCC is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Bitica to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.biticablockchain.com/](https://status.biticablockchain.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BDCC. Which means validators with higher amounts of Bitica staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BDCC holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BDCC they wish. They receive a share of the Bitica block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BDCC is the native currency on Bitica, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BDCC transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BDCC tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Bitica platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
